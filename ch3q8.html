<h1>Chapter 3 Question 8</h1>
<h2>The answer is in the console!</h2>

<p>The digital root of an integer n is defined as the result of summing the digits repeatedly until only a single digit remains.
  For example, the digital root of 1729 can be calculated using the following steps:
Because the total at the end of step 3 is the single digit 1, that value is the digital root. Write a function digitalRoot that returns this value.</p>
