<h1>Chapter 2 Question 2</h1>

<p>Write a function quotient that takes two numbers, x and y (which you may assume are both positive integers), and returns the integral
   quotient of x / y, discarding any remainder. For example, calling quotient(9, 4) should return 2 because four goes into nine twice with
   a remainder of one left over. This function is easy to write if you use the Math.floor function; the challenge in this exercise is to write
  quotient using only the standard arithmetic operators.</p>
